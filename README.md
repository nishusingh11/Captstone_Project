# Captstone_Project
<b>Analysis and experimental forecasting of earthquakes in the US</b>
  <br>
<p><h8>The project covers an in-depth analysis of earthquake patterns in the United States, spanning area, year, and the top five earthquakes recorded in the country from 2000 to Feb 2023. The study involves collecting and analysing historical data, as well as employing experimental approaches to forecast future
earthquakes. For time series forecasting of earthquake data, this study makes use of ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and LSTM models. The goal is to get a
better knowledge of the origins and effects of seismic activity, as well as to develop forecasting tools to assist in mitigating the effects of earthquakes on infrastructure and communities. The study's findings will help to improve understanding of earthquake trends in the United States, as well as support the creation of effective disaster mitigation and management policies and methods.
